Roadmap

 - Fix weir trap crash, playtest with Copygirl's mod.
 - Make deadfall and snare trap more effective, and/or prevent larger mobs from being attracted to them/tripping them.  Investigate blunt attack in 3rd person for snare.
 - Add fillet fish functionality for better inventory management/cooking
 - Investigate fish in soup/stew recipes not rendering in pot/bowl
 - Double check logic around relics in fish traps (i.e. gears)
 - Work on smoking rack
 - Pan dirt for worms, higher soil fertility, better results
 - Remove rotten fish from traps after a certain amount of time - they tend to pile up, especially on multiplayer
 - Taxidermy
 - Add mushrooms and meat to bait types
 - Investigate fishing in general - is it too easy?  too hard?  
 
Version 2.4 updates

 - Changed 3rd person handheld fish so they're more like holding a lantern than a club.  Changed 1st person to match somewhat.
 - Fixed some minor z-fighting issues with fish.

Version 2.3 updates

 - Added - metal buckets, along with smithing recipes for handles and recipes for the buckets themselves.
 - Fixed monkey bridge break/drops issues.

 - Fixed bug that was allowing stakes to be replaced with other blocks.
 - Fixed steatite stair placement.

- made fishing lure mold and fighing hook mold "rackable"
- added monkey bridge and recipe
- added metal bucket
- added spike and nail mold 
- fixed RC8 fishing crash (related to meteoric iron)
