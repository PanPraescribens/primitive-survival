# Primitive Survival

<h2>Primitive Survival mod for Vintage Story</h2>

https://www.vintagestory.at/

<h3>ATTENTION users of versions 1.3 and older:</h3>
Limb lines and trotlines have undergone a significant change in version 2.0, and will NOT load properly if you simply upgrade to version 2.0.  I've learned my lesson but there's no going back!  You have two options: 
<br><br>
1. Retrieve all of your existing limb lines, trotlines, and whatever's on them prior to upgrading, or <br><br>
2. Simply upgrade.  You will lose all limb lines and trotlines and whatever's on them, and will have to remove the old (white) blocks after the fact.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Here's the thing: I'm a huge fan of Vintage Story and especially its <i>Wilderness Survival</i> mode. I also have a keen interest in real life primitive survival. This mod is my attempt to to meld the two to provide you with a more realistic early game experience. It also adds some new things to keep you busy at any point during the game.
<br><br>

<i>A huge THANKS goes out to <b>Siddly</b> (over on the Vintage Story Discord) for providing a few real cool fish for this mod!</i>

<h3>Version 2.0 Updates:</h3>

- Sharpen a handful of sticks to create a bundle of wood spikes (for pit traps).
- Make a bone hook with a knife and a bone.
- Use clay forming to make molds for metal fishing hooks, fishing lures, and a bed-o-nails (for even better pit traps). Add lures to hooks to catch more fish.
- Fixed a couple of bugs, including one that was preventing the book from appearing in game, and one that was preventing fish from entering fish baskets (it's a good thing I'm not getting paid for this!).<br><br>

<h3>Version 1.3 Updates:</h3>

- Added all fish to soup and stew recipes.
- Animation added to fish.
- unbaited fishing is now much more difficult. To offset this change, I've made it a lot less likely that fish will steal your bait.
- More updates to the end game items (the things that shall not be named), including some new gear types and a new elusive fish type.

<h3>Basics</h3>

The handbook now contains relatively complete instructions for this mod. Look under <b>Guides - Primitive Survival: Quick Start Guide</b>.

<img src="docs/handbook.png" alt="Handbook" height="400px">

A couple of items that are essential for this mod are <b>stakes</b> (used to build weir traps and snares) and <b>cordage</b> (used to make limb lines, trotlines, fish baskets, and snares). Stakes also make a good fence to protect you early on (think "boma").

<h3>Traps</h3>

<img src="docs/splash1.jpg" alt="Splash1" width="682px">

There are two traps - the <b>Deadfall</b> and the <b>Snare</b> - and they are very similar in nature. They are designed to kill small animals on your behalf. The only real difference is that the deadfall might kill a chicken or a hare (or a baby anything), while the snare might be able to take down bigger entities (like a fox or a boar) as well. In both cases:

- Larger entities (like a player or a wolf) will only take a bit of damage when coming into contact with one of these traps, and will trip it.
- Bait your traps or it's pretty unlikely you'll catch anything.
- Once a trap's been tripped, you can sneak - right click to set it again (with nothing in your hand).
- You can right click on any unbaited set trap to bait it (with a wide variety of food in hand).

<h4>Deadfall</h4>

<h4>Snare</h4>

<sup>Cordage and a stake</sup><br><br>

While not a trap per se, a handful of sticks can be sharpened at both ends to create a bundle of wood spikes, which can then be pushed into soft ground to create a pit of spikes. They're a little painful to walk across, and even more dangerous to fall on.

<h4>Bundle of Wood Spikes</h4>

Once you've started clay forming, you can make a mold for a "bed-o-nails", which can be place on any surface and act as a much deadlier version of wood spikes.

<h3>Fishing</h3>

<img src="docs/splash2.jpg" alt="Splash2" width="682px">

There are currently four methods for fishing - a <b>Fish Basket</b>, a <b>Weir Trap</b>, a <b>Limb Line</b>, and <b>Trotline</b>. They have some similarities but your mileage may vary when it comes to a preferred method. For the most part:

- A fish might simply steal your bait.
- You can right click to remove fish (with nothing in your hand). Careful though, they're a little slippery!
- You can right click on an unbaited hook or fish basket to re-bait it (with a wide variety of food in hand).
- Right click on a baited hook or fish basket to retrieve the bait (with nothing in your hand).

The fish basket is pretty strightforward. Place it in water but make sure there's free blocks of water all around it. Now hurry up and wait...and maybe one or two fish will find their way into your basket.

<h4>Fish Basket</h4>

<sup>Four cordage and four sticks</sup><br>

<br>

The weir trap is not so obvious. You build a fenced in area with stakes, and then sneak-right click on the far side (center) of the fence to complete the trap. Note: You cannot bait a weir trap.
<br><br>

<img src="docs/weirtrap.jpg" alt="Weir Trap" width="682px">

You might want to check on your fish basket or weir trap a little more frequently than something with a hook, since fish can escape quite easily. Also note that the occasional sea shell or other trinket might drift into one of these two traps.

<br>

The trotline and limb line are a little more complicated because you're going to need <b>hooks</b>. Hooks can be knapped with flint or one of several stones, or carved from a bone.

<h4>Bone Fishing Hook <i>(Shapeless)</i></h4>

<sup>A knife and a bone</sup><br><br>

Face an object near water (i.e. a stake) with cordage in hand, and right click. If you have enough cordage and there's a block to receive the far end of the cordage, you'll place a trotline. Otherwise you'll place a limb line. Once your line is in place you'll need to attach hooks (and perhaps bait them) by right clicking on a section of that line (with hook in hand). Obviously if your hook isn't in water you won't catch a fish.

Once you've started clay forming, you can make a mold for metal fishing hooks and a mold for fishing lures. Lures are added to hooks just like baiting a hook, and will also improve your odds of catching fish.<br><br>

What do I do with all these raw fish? Cook 'em up on a fire and eat 'em of course. Note: The official Vintage Story Survival Bass had some issues with it's configuration, so I "borrowed" its json file/shape/texture, and reworked it as <b>Small Bass</b> (for lack of a better name).

<h3>Jerky</h3>

The premise here is that you can "cure" meat to create <b>Jerky</b> by simply cutting it up into small strips and letting it dry in the sun. So if you cut up your redmeat or bushmeat it will start to cure automatically. Note: You can still cook it on a fire afterwards if you like (before it cures).

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

- The road is long, with many a winding turn...that leads us to who knows where, who knows where.
