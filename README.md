 - COULD NOT RECREATE: investigate this mod and medieval expansion not playing nice together @Kai
 - COULD NOT RECREATE: Tin bronze/copper in a lure mold just resets and adds metal to the crucible? Sounds like server lag @Nozarati, @TechRabbit
 - COULD NOT RECREATE: disappearing fish.  They will pop off the hook then just go poof before I can pick them up.  Maybe ice related? - thanks @willrun4fun
-------------------
 
 - again -  weir traps arn't working "kind of" The latest version offsets them a little, they still work but look bad. - thanks @TechRabbit
 - add: config file to disable assets - thanks @techrabbit
 -

Version 2.5.1 updates

 - fixed: Re-enabled placement of hides on ALL surfaces
 
Version 2.5 updates

 - added: Earthworms.
 - added: Russian translation, courtesy of zipthehedge.
 - fixed: Added a patch to re-enable the creation of small pelts.  Didn't realize this got disabled in Vanilla recently.


Version 2.4 updates

 - New: fish fillet functionality for better inventory management/cooking - new item, new recipe, added to soup/stew recipes
 - New: basic taxidermy - place pelts on the floor for rugs.  Made them a little derpy to reduce z-fighting issues with large ones.  Might need a better long term solution.
 - Updated: jerky, mushrooms, bread, poultry, pickled vegetables, redmeat, bushmeat, and cheese to accepted bait types for snares, deadfalls, trot lines, limblines, and fish baskets
 - Updated: 3rd person handheld fish so they're more like holding a lantern than a club.  Changed 1st person to match somewhat.
 - Updated: More frequently removed rotten fish after a certain amount of time - they tend to pile up, especially on multiplayer.
 - Updated: Investigated fishing in general and made some minor changes to catch percents
 - Updated: Made deadfall and snare trap slightly more effective to hopefully scare off larger animals
 - Fixed: some minor z-fighting issues with fish.
 - Fixed: (More than likely) intermittent weir trap crash - prevented collisions from unsetting trap AND prevented the sneak-click from recreating trap if it was already a weir trap.
 - Fixed: Removed giant weird shadow from deadfall and fishbasket on land
 - Fixed fish in soup/stew recipes now rendering properly in pots and bowls
 - Fixed: Removed shapeless from monkey bridge grid recipe so it would pull items from the correct slots
 - Verified: Logic around relics in fish traps (i.e. gears) - seems to be aok
 - Verified: ozBillo's bushmeat mod together with this mod - seems good!

Version 2.3 updates

 - Added - metal buckets, along with smithing recipes for handles and recipes for the buckets themselves.
 - Fixed monkey bridge break/drops issues.
 - Fixed sounds for most everything.
 - Fixed bug that was allowing stakes to be replaced with other blocks.
 - Fixed steatite stair placement.

Version 2.2 updates

- made fishing lure mold and fighing hook mold "rackable"
- added monkey bridge and recipe
- added metal bucket
- added spike and nail mold 
- fixed RC8 fishing crash (related to meteoric iron)
