Here's the thing - I'm a huge fan of Vintage Story and especially its wilderness survival mode. I also have a keen interest in real life primitive survival. This mod is my attempt to meld the two to provide you with a more realistic early game experience, and is largely inspired by extreme survival shows like Naked & Afraid.   Primitive Survival also adds some new end-game type elements to entertain you later in the game. 
Note: A huge THANKS goes out to @Unclesid for providing a few real cool fish for this mod!
  
  
  
"This is seriously the best mod for this game there is. It's so amazing that I hope it all gets integrated into the base game to some degree, because I couldn't imagine playing without it at this point. The functionality is superb." - l33tmaan 

"You're kicking @$$ with this mod brother. Best one I've played so far. Looking forward to what else you have planned!" - PapaCheddar 

"I'm pretty sure your mod is my favorite out of all of the mods I've used so far (if I had to lose all but one mod, I'd probably keep this one). It's very near perfect in terms of what I enjoy in mods like these (it creates new gameplay options, offers immersive ways of doing things, and is not overly complicated)." - Ariel

The in-game handbook contains more than enough information to get you going.  Look under Guides - Primitive Survival: Quick Start Guide. 
 
  
A couple of items that are essential for this mod are stakes (used for primitive fences, weir traps and snares) and cordage (used to make limb lines, trotlines, fish baskets, snares, and monkey bridges).

Stake (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types), and a stick 
Spoiler 
 

Cordage (Shapeless) - Three cattails or wildvine tips, or two wild vines 
Spoiler 
 

  
  
 
There are three types of traps - a deadfall, snare, and pit trap.

 
The deadfall and snare are very similar in nature. They are designed to kill small animals on contact. The only real difference is that the deadfall might kill a chicken or a hare (or a baby anything), while the snare might be able to take down bigger entities (like a fox or a boar) as well. In both cases: 
•	Larger entities (like a player or a wolf) will only take a minor amount of damage when coming into contact with one of these traps, and will trip it. 
•	Only a baited trap will actually attract animals to it. 
•	Once a trap has been tripped, you can sneak - right click to set it again (with nothing in your hand). 
•	You can right click on any unbaited set trap to bait it (with a wide variety of food in hand). 
Deadfall - A stone (one of various types), and a stick 
Spoiler 
 

Snare - Cordage and a stake 
Spoiler 
 


While not a trap on its own, a handful of sticks can be sharpened at both ends to create a bundle of wood spikes, which can then be pushed into soft ground to create a pit of spikes. They're a little painful to walk across, and even more dangerous to fall on. 

 
  
Bundle of Wood Spikes - A knife (one of various types) surrounded by sticks 
Spoiler 
 


To make a fully fledged pit trap, use these same wood spikes but also push them into the sides of the top edge of your pit. Note: You can weave them together to span large areas. The next step is to add three layers of dry grass or some other plant based materials to seal up the surface. Pay attention to what it says in the hud. It walks you through the process.  The final step is to add a layer of dirt or sand to the top. With proper planning, your pit cover will be 100% camouflaged which could be interesting in pvp play.


 
Watch: Primitive Survival - Pit Trap

With dirt or sand in place, nearby mammals can tell that something still isn't quite right, and are attracted to your pit to investigate (increasing your odds of catching something).  Note, you can also partially disassemble your pit trap by clicking on it (with nothing in your active inventory slot). 
Once you've started clay forming, you can make a mold for a Bed-O-Nails, which act as a much deadlier version of wood spikes (and can be placed on any surface). 
  
 
  
  
 
There are currently four methods for fishing - a fish basket, weir trap, limb line, and trotline. They have some similarities but also some distinct differences. In general: 
•	Right click to remove fish (with nothing in your hand). Careful though, they're a little slippery! 
•	Right click on a hook or fish basket to bait it (with a wide variety of food in hand). 
•	Right click on a baited hook or fish basket to retrieve the bait (with nothing in your hand). 
•	A fish might simply steal your bait. 
The fish basket is pretty straightforward. Place it in water but make sure there's free blocks of water all around it. Now hurry up and wait...and maybe one or two fish will find their way into your basket.

 

Fish Basket - Four cordage and four sticks 
Spoiler 
 

Building a weir trap is not so obvious. You simply build a fenced in area in the water with stakes, and then with nothing in hand, sneak-right click on the far side (center) of the fence to complete the trap. If the fence forms an "M" shape  your trap is complete.  Note: You cannot bait a weir trap.
  
 
Watch - Primitive Survival - Weir Trap

You might want to check on your fish basket or weir trap a little more frequently than something with a hook, since fish can escape quite easily. Also note that the occasional sea shell or other trinket might drift into one of these two traps. 
The trotline and limb line are a little more complicated because you're also going to need hooks. 
 
  
Hooks can be knapped with flint or one of several stones, or carved from a bone.

 

Bone Fishing Hook (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types) and a bone 
Spoiler 
 

To place your limb line or trotline, face an object near water (i.e. a stake, fencepost, dirt block, tree) with cordage in hand, and right click. If you have enough cordage and there's a block to receive the far end of the cordage, you'll place a trotline. Otherwise you'll place a limb line. Once your line is in place you'll need to attach hooks (and perhaps bait them) by right clicking on a section of that line (with hook in hand). Obviously if your hook isn't in water you won't catch a fish.
  
 
Watch - Primitive Survival - Limb Line and Trotline 
Once you've started clay forming, you can make a mold for metal fishing hooks and a mold for fishing lures. Lures are added to hooks just like baiting a hook, and like bait, they will also improve your odds of catching fish. 
 
  
What do I do with all these raw fish? Cook them up on a fire and eat them of course, or substitute them for meat in your favorite soup or stew!   
 
  
For better inventory and cooking management, you can now fillet your fish first.  Worth noting that by doing so, you are removing valuable fish parts like the head, so you lose a bit of nutritional value.

Fish Fillet (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types) and a raw fish 
Spoiler 
 

  
 
  
  
 
The premise here is that you can "cure" meat to create Jerky by simply cutting it up into small strips and letting it dry in the sun. So if you cut up your redmeat, bushmeat, or fish fillets, and they will start to cure automatically. Note: You can still cook it on a fire afterwards if you like (before it cures). 

 
  
Raw Redmeat Jerky (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types) and a piece of redmeat 
Spoiler 
 

Raw Bushmeat Jerky (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types) and a piece of bushmeat 
Spoiler 
 
 
Fish Jerky (Shapeless) - A knife (one of various types), four fish fillets, and one salt 
Spoiler 
 

  
  
 
Build yourself a raft to travel on water with ease.  With a raft in your active inventory slot, jump in the water and steer your way to your destination.  The raft does the rest! 

 
  
Raft - 9 logs, 4 cordage 
Spoiler 
 

  
Build some wooden lanterns to light up your life. 

 
  
Wooden Lantern - 1 candle, 1 copper plate, and 7 boards 
Spoiler 
 

  
Collect some earthworms and put them to good use.  Anywhere there's soil and a reasonable climate, you'll find worms, but you'll need to look (right click) on rocks and branches to locate them.  When you encounter a worm please remember - don't panic, breathe deeply, and maintain eye contact. Although they may look intimidating at first, they are in fact docile creatures.   
Handling and use: 
•	Right click OR sneak right click to pick up or place a worm. 
•	Eat them for a small protein boost. 
•	Use them to bait your hooks or fish baskets. 
•	Place them (sneak-click) on your farmland to both aerate and fertilize the soil. 
•	Use them to make your own fertilizer. For example: 
o	Dig a small hole and use a hoe to turn the bottom of the hole into farmland 
o	place worm(s) in the hole 
o	Eventually, the worms will turn that farmland into a block of pure worm castings 
o	break the block of worm castings and use those drops to fertilize your garden. 
Warning:  Don't introduce too many worms into your garden - eventually they will over-aerate/fertilize your farmland, turning it into pure worm castings, and the soil will no longer have the structural integrity to keep your plants growing.  You've been warned! 
Pro-tip:  Worms will occasionally leave the area or are whisked away by a predator, so pick them up if you want to extend their use.  They will also die in extreme temperatures if left outside. 
 
  
Throw your pelts on the floor or roof or walls to liven up your abode.

   
 
 
  
Make yourself a monkey bridge to get across large ravines or lakes with ease. 
 
Watch - Primitive Survival - Monkey Bridge 
Monkey Bridge - Two cordage and a rope 
Spoiler 
 

  
Build a metal bucket to move lava around, decorate your home, or maybe pour some into your pit trap to quickly dispose of undesirables. 
    
Spoiler 
Smith a metal handle (using one of several metal types). 
 
Combine that handle with five metal plates (iron, meteoric iron, or steel) on the crafting grid to complete your bucket. 
 

  
There's some other surprises in Primitive Survival that have been intentionally left undocumented.  Have a look at the Creative Inventory to get a glimpse at these "things that shall not be named". 
  
 
  
Custom Mod Configuration (only applies to v2.6.0 or newer):   
For Windows users, look here: 
C:\Users\<userid>\AppData\Roaming\VintagestoryData\ModConfig\primitivesurvival.json
You can edit this json file with your favorite text editor (or notepad) to customize your Primitive Survival experience.  A few caveats - don't change the overall structure of the files or remove or add rows, only change the assigned values.   You can change a true to a false, or an integer to a different integer, or a decimal to a different decimal.  For example, a number like 0.3 could be changed to 0.5 or 1.0, but don't change it to .5 or 1 - keep the overall "look" of the number the same.  Likewise, don't change a number like 5 to 5.5 or 6.0, it's probably expecting a whole number like 6.

If things go awry, you could delete the file completely, and the next time you start the game the file will be recreated in that same location with the original (default) values.  Below is a brief explanation of each setting.

•	Updated: jerky, mushrooms, bread, poultry, pickled vegetables, red meat, bushmeat, and cheese to accepted bait types for snares, deadfalls, trot lines, limblines, and fish baskets. 
•	Updated: 3rd person handheld fish so they're more like holding a lantern than a club. Changed 1st person to match somewhat. 
•	Updated: Remove rotten fish occasionally from hooks and other fishing traps - they tend to pile up, especially on multiplayer.

Version 2.0 Release Notes 
•	Sharpen a handful of sticks to create a bundle of wood spikes (for pit traps). 
•	Make a bone hook with a knife and a bone.

**Version 2.4 updates**

 - New: fish fillet functionality for better inventory management/cooking - new item, new recipe, added to soup/stew recipes
 - New: basic taxidermy - place pelts on the floor for rugs.  Made them a little derpy to reduce z-fighting issues with large ones.  Might need a better long term solution.
 - Updated: jerky, mushrooms, bread, poultry, pickled vegetables, redmeat, bushmeat, and cheese to accepted bait types for snares, deadfalls, trot lines, limblines, and fish baskets
 - Updated: 3rd person handheld fish so they're more like holding a lantern than a club.  Changed 1st person to match somewhat.

 - Updated: Made deadfall and snare trap slightly more effective to hopefully scare off larger animals

 - Fixed: Removed shapeless from monkey bridge grid recipe so it would pull items from the correct slots
