 - fixed: Added a patch to re-enable the creation of small pelts.  Didn't realize this got disabled in Vanilla recently.


Version 2.4 updates

 - New: fish fillet functionality for better inventory management/cooking - new item, new recipe, added to soup/stew recipes
 - New: basic taxidermy - place pelts on the floor for rugs.  Made them a little derpy to reduce z-fighting issues with large ones.  Might need a better long term solution.
 - Updated: jerky, mushrooms, bread, poultry, pickled vegetables, redmeat, bushmeat, and cheese to accepted bait types for snares, deadfalls, trot lines, limblines, and fish baskets
 - Updated: 3rd person handheld fish so they're more like holding a lantern than a club.  Changed 1st person to match somewhat.
 - Updated: More frequently removed rotten fish after a certain amount of time - they tend to pile up, especially on multiplayer.
 - Updated: Investigated fishing in general and made some minor changes to catch percents
 - Updated: Made deadfall and snare trap slightly more effective to hopefully scare off larger animals
 - Fixed: some minor z-fighting issues with fish.
 - Fixed: (More than likely) intermittent weir trap crash - prevented collisions from unsetting trap AND prevented the sneak-click from recreating trap if it was already a weir trap.
 - Fixed: Removed giant weird shadow from deadfall and fishbasket on land
 - Fixed fish in soup/stew recipes now rendering properly in pots and bowls
 - Fixed: Removed shapeless from monkey bridge grid recipe so it would pull items from the correct slots
 - Verified: Logic around relics in fish traps (i.e. gears) - seems to be aok
 - Verified: ozBillo's bushmeat mod together with this mod - seems good!

 - Fixed monkey bridge break/drops issues.
 - Fixed sounds for most everything.
